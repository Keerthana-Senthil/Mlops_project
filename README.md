# End to End Avocado Price Prediction MLOPS Project

## Project Overview
This project leverages a complete MLOps pipeline to predict avocado prices using historical data. The pipeline includes data preprocessing with Apache Spark, orchestration with Apache Airflow, model tracking with MLFlow, and a REST API monitored using Prometheus and visualized with Grafana.

## Key Features
- Data Preprocessing: Automated using Apache Spark for cleansing, munging, transformation, and vectorization.
- Pipeline Orchestration: Managed with Apache Airflow.
- Experiment Tracking: Utilizing MLFlow to track experiments, including parameters and metrics.
- REST API: Provides endpoints for model interactions.
- Monitoring and Visualization: Integrated with Prometheus and Grafana.
- Containerization: Using Docker for deployment.

## Prerequisites
- Docker
- Python 3.8+
- Apache Spark 3.x
- Apache Airflow 2.x
- MLFlow
